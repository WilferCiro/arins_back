# NestJS Project with Hexagonal Architecture and MongoDB

This repository contains a NestJS project that follows the Hexagonal Architecture pattern and uses MongoDB as the underlying database.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into the following folders:

1. **application**: This folder contains the application layer of the Hexagonal Architecture. It defines the use cases and orchestrates the flow of data between the domain and infrastructure layers. Each use case is implemented as a separate module within this folder.

2. **domain**: The domain folder holds the core business logic and domain models of the application. It is independent of any external dependencies and represents the heart of the Hexagonal Architecture.

3. **architecture**: This folder contains the infrastructure implementation details. It includes frameworks, libraries, and databases. In this project, we use mongodb as the underlying database, and the code for interacting with the database is placed within this folder.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js (version v18.16.0 or higher)
- NPM (version 9.5.1)
- MongoDB database

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/WilferCiro/sales_backend.git
  cd sales_backend
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

3. Configure the MongoDB database connection creating a .env file and add the sql database credentials, and other required environment variables

```bash
MONGODB_URI=URL

SENDGRID_API_KEY=
SENDGRID_USER=
SENDGRID_EMAIL=

PORT=5001
```

4. Start the application:

```bash
  npm run start
```
